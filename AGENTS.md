## ⛔ Mandatory Rules (Read First, Apply Always)

These rules apply at every context start, mid-session, and after any restart.
Violating any of them is a hard error - not a judgment call.

1. **NEVER make any code change without explicit user approval first.**
   - Present the proposed change (file, location, what and why) and wait for the user to say "go ahead", "yes", "do it", or equivalent.
   - "Continue" or "proceed" on a previously approved plan is sufficient only if the exact change was described and approved in that same session before the context restart.
   - When in doubt: ask, do not act.

2. **NEVER commit or push without explicit user instruction.**

3. **After a context restart, always summarize what you know from AGENTS.md and ask the user how to proceed - do not resume coding autonomously.**

4. **If a command, path, class name, endpoint, or workflow is uncertain, say so explicitly.**
   - Do not invent commands or repository structure.

## Verified Commands

**To verify commands safely:**
1. Ask user to test the command when local environment access is needed
2. Add successful commands to this section
3. Do not claim a command is correct unless it was verified from this repo or by successful execution

| Command | Description | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| `pip install -r requirements.txt` | Install legacy/full Python dependencies | Documented in repo; not executed in this session |
| `pip install -r requirements-ui.txt` | Install Streamlit-focused Python dependencies | Documented in repo; not executed in this session |
| `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` | Run Streamlit MVP app | Documented in repo; not executed in this session |
| `npm run build` | Build standalone frontend | Executed successfully in `frontend/` during this session |
| `npm run build-storybook` | Build Storybook static site | Executed successfully in `frontend/` during this session |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run Playwright E2E tests | Executed successfully in `frontend/` during this session |

## Working Style

This repository follows a human-in-the-loop development workflow:
1. **Plan** the change and get approval
2. **Implement** after explicit approval
3. **Validate** via commands, tests, or user-reported run results
4. **Debug** using exact user-provided errors/logs

### Development Approach
- **Prefer small, focused changes** over large refactors
- **Follow existing patterns** in nearby files before creating new ones
- **Use exact evidence** from logs, errors, and test results
- **Inspect adjacent files** in the same module to match local conventions
- **Do not claim verification** unless something was actually tested
- **Do not say a fix is confirmed** unless validated by successful command/test/user report

### When Debugging
- Identify the **first meaningful exception** and root cause chain
- Separate **startup failures** from **runtime failures**
- Use **specific error messages** instead of generic guesses
- Ask for the most relevant missing output only when needed

---

## Boundaries & Constraints

### What NOT to assume
- Exact dataset availability or local file paths
- GPU availability or CUDA setup
- Model checkpoint compatibility without evidence
- Endpoint URLs/ports unless shown in code or run output
- Performance claims without benchmark evidence

### Before making changes
1. **Describe the change** (files, purpose, expected effect)
2. **Wait for approval** before editing
3. **Follow local patterns** from the same module/package
4. **Ask about uncertainties** rather than guessing

### ML / Analysis Pipeline Caution
Before modifying model inference, sampling, or risk logic:
- Review current behavior in `ui_mvp/analysis.py` and `ui_mvp/config.py`
- Keep threshold logic and reporting semantics consistent unless user requests a behavior change
- Call out any effect on verdict/confidence/risk interpretation

## Response Format

When helping with this repository:
1. **State diagnosis** briefly
2. **Propose minimal change** needed
3. **List specific files** to edit
4. **Provide validation steps** if known
5. **Mention what remains unverified**
6. **Separate confirmed facts from assumptions**
7. **Wait for approval** before implementing
